I found that the toilet wasn\u2019t cleaned properly so I did that for our safety and peace of mind. I really liked the water pressure and diff features in shower faucet and the mini fridge in room came in handy to store my dog\u2019s food. The house is quiet and the area seems to be the same way. Parking isn\u2019t always readily available outside of the home so expect to drive around a little to catch a spot if you\u2019re not lucky.",

I reached out earlier in the day to see if I can check in a bit early due to my arrival time, and Bill was extremely responsive and accommodating.

Upon checking out I left my watch in the room, and when I reached back out again, Bill was responsive, super quick and let me into the room to retrieve my items.

I\u2019m an Eagles fan, she\u2019s a Steelers fan, and the game was on our first anniversary.\n\nWe ended up with room #5, which was the larger room. We enjoyed it very much and the house isn\u2019t too far away from other places we went like restaurants. We also Ubered everywhere once we got to the house because parking is limited. I found a spot down the street and did not move my car until we checked out lol.\n\nWe also ended up leaving a charger accidentally and Benjamin mailed it to us. Overall it was a great stay!",

The room was clean and the bed was comfortable I was in town to watch a Phillies game and it's hard to beat this location's value - it's within walking distance of a SEPTA stop (one stop away from the sports complex), or if you'd prefer to drive or take a rideshare to either the sports complex or to Center City, it's not a long trip at all. Parking can be tricky, as you're in a densely populated urban neighborhood, but be patient and you shouldn't have much trouble finding street parking nearby. I would definitely stay here again if the opportunity arose.",

A quick 5 mins uber($10) or a 25-30 min walk (long blocks)\n\nThis is my second AirBNB I\u2019ve stayed at and it\u2019s Great AirBNB and as described! Simple and  Super Clean! No extra bells or whistles! Ben does a great job on messaging fast and understands your needs, just ask him! The room and house were a clean and a secure place with cameras in the common areas as well as outside. The room I booked was very much up to date and modern. \n\nThe neighborhood is hit or miss changes block by block,  rough areas are going west near  6th-9th streets. 5th-2nd streets are the mellow streets\n\nShort Uber drive anywhere you want to go! Great spot seriously. I would stay here again! A+",

Had a few issues with the hot water going out while showering, but didn\u2019t mind so much as it was usually when the cleaning person was washing linens. Parking on a Saturday night is pretty much non existent, but not Benjamin\u2019s fault. Room had a little private yard access as well which I absolutely loved. Everything was easily accessible via Uber at a affordable rates. 10/10 would recommend. I will definitely be staying at Benjamin\u2019s home again. Thank you for all the prompt replies as well!  Had a great time. Oh!! and the Keurig with complimentary pods was a great touch! Mini fridge is excellent as well!!!",

The place was about a 10 minute drive to the arena so not far at all! Benjamin was super awesome and allowed me to drop my bags off early which i appreciate so much because It allowed me to head straight over to the venue and queue in line without having to worry about my luggage. I spent the entire day queuing in line for the show so I didn\u2019t arrive back at Benjamins place until around 11pm. His place served as a safe place for me to keep my things during the day and a quiet and peaceful environment for me to get some rest after the show which is all I was looking for! The place is very clean and you can tell it has been newly renovated! I would definitely stay again if I am ever in town",

        "comment": "The room was nice, and close to the sports stadiums. Nothing too special just a bed, TV and a bathroom with a common shared kitchen area. Bottled water provided was nice. Unfortunately check-in was not smooth, arrived in Philly in the morning and was waiting for a few hours to receive check in instructions (keypad code, wifi, etc.) and didn't receive any communication until nearly 2:00 PM despite our check-in time being 1:00PM which was very concerning as we were forced to just wander around the city until we heard back from the host. We were unsure due to the lack of communication if we were going to have to find somewhere new to stay last minute which would have been very stressful.",

Looks like a hotel inside with the doors with number lock to get in and you have your own bathroom. Nice TV Roku and really spacious room. My man and I stayed only one night for the Eagles NFL Game and it was so close to the stadium. The only not so good was looking for a parking spot, it took us about 10min driving. But honestly I don't mind the parking spot bcz It wasn't that hard(just a little) but it was an amazing room. I will totally recommend and possibly come back for the next game",
